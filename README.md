### Hi, im a 15 year old passionate programmer willing to learn new things. Also a frequent gamer.
My goals are to work in a job in cyber security, and make some breakthrough in the IT world.
I would like to help people understand programming in my free time too since it really satisfies me :D
I dislike being left out in a discussion because I dont understand it so I will always take effort to learn a lot of things.
